"Class 10 Science delves into fundamental principles across Physics and Chemistry. In Chemistry, students learn about types of chemical reactions, the properties of acids, bases, and salts, the characteristics of metals and non-metals, and the vast world of carbon compounds, including their bonding and nomenclature. Physics covers essential concepts like electricity, including Ohm's Law and heating effects, the phenomena of light reflection and refraction, the human eye and its defects, and the magnetic effects of electric current, illustrating the interconnections between electricity and magnetism.",
"Biology focuses on the intricate processes sustaining life, such as nutrition, respiration, transport, and excretion. It also explores control and coordination in living organisms, various methods of reproduction, and the foundational principles of heredity and evolution. Additionally, the curriculum addresses environmental concerns, including ecosystems, energy flow, and sustainable management of natural resources, fostering an understanding of our impact on the planet and the importance of conservation for a sustainable future."
