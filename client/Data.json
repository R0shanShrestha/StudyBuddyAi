    "text1": "The history of God spans across cultures and centuries, beginning with ancient nature worship and progressing through polytheism to monotheistic religions. Early civilizations like the Egyptians, Mesopotamians, Greeks, and Hindus worshipped multiple gods representing natural and cosmic forces. Artistic and mythological representations played key roles in these traditions. Later, the idea of a single, all-powerful God developed in Zoroastrianism and then in Abrahamic religionsâ€”Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In modern times, divine concepts have evolved, blending traditional beliefs with philosophical and cultural interpretations.",
    "text2": "A History of God is a book by Karen Armstrong that was published by Knopf in 1993. It details the history of the three major monotheistic traditions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, along with some details on Buddhism and Hinduism.",
